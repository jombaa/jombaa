# About meüëÄ

I have finished my bachelor in Applied Computer Science at OsloMet University, with a specialization in programming.

During my studies I have gained an understanding of web applications, computer security, operating systems, resource-efficient programs, databases, Internet of Things, software engineering, human computer interaction and software testing and I have worked on an artificial intelligence project. We made a music app for our bachelor thesis where you can see smaller concerts in your area on a interactive map.
